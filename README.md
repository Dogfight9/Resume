# Michael Myers' Resume Project

While updating my resume and looking at potential job listings, I realized I needed to learn more about CI/CD to become more marketable. Then I saw a comment on reddit telling the OP to make her resume using LaTeX with Github actions to automate the creation of the pdfs. I liked the idea and am implementing it here.
